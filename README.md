I created this program to help a friend who is unfamiliar with coding. It can be done with better time complexity, but the language this friend uses is a learning language that can only use lists, loops, and limited data types. It doesn't offer the same functions and features that real programming languages do. This resulted in the program being inefficient as I tried to match their limitations, but it works as intended.

This project was made to demonstrate how many extra days are added from a given range of years due to leap years.
The user enters two years: one starting year and one ending year.
Afterwards, the program calculates how many extra days have been added from leap years.
This can be implemented into a program that calculates how many days are between two given dates.
